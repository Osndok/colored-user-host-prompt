h2. Purpose

Intends to provide a visually different prompt for each (user,machine) tuple that:
* that is visually and intuitively different
** to help prevent sending a command to one machine that was intended for another (when you have terminals open for SO MANY different machines)
* has the same/useful/familiar information (the text of the prompt itself is not actually changed)
* without having to *configure* each one to be different

The exception to this is when the shell is the 'root' user (on any machine), which is simply bold/red to:
* remind you that the shell should probably not be left open
* remind you to be careful with what you type
* to avoid all the extra calls to 'other binaries' that calculating and applying the shell colors would require
** often, when you are using root, stuff might be broken... and you would probably still want a usable prompt.

h2. Features

* layout is the default prompt from fedora/redhat
* hostname color should:
** change from machine to machine
** stay the same on the same machine with different users
** stay the same from one shell to the next
* username color should:
** change from user-to-user
** change from machine to machine (even if login is same!)
** stay the same on the same machine with different users
** stay the same from one shell to the next
* should not interfere with readline character counting
